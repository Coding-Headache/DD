# Lab Task 2 - Combinational Circuit Modelling I

## Part 1
This task was to produce a truth table relating to the 7 segment display on the `Altera`, remembering that the signals work "backwards" on a 7seg display,so in order to have an element light up the signal must be 0, and in order to have it off, 1.

From the [truth tables](Tables.pdf) the `Karnaugh Maps(K-maps)` can be produced, allowing for the development of the boolean expressions for the task.

Use the simplified expressions to produce a 7-segment display controller.

## Part 2
Refine the code from task 1 so that it could be expanded in the future, enabling reusable code.
