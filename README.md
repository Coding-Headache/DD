## Digital Design
This is a module studied during my 2nd year `BSc Computer Systems Integration` at the University of the West of England _**(UWE)**_

## Lab Work
I am currently using `Quartus II 13.0 sp1 web edition` to build the projects themselves and *atom.io* as my text editor.  All of these projects are written for the **Cyclone III** family of chips, with which I am using the `EP3C16F484C6N`.
